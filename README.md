# Optimization - Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) task
The aim of this study is to investigate models for task group (TG) air defense that captures the reality of anti-ship missiles (ASM) defense, generates an efficient allocation plan and measures the effectiveness of the air defense under a given scenario. Then we want to discuss the possible application of these models in other areas.

## Background
WTA problem can be stated as the optimal allocation of existing weapons to a set of targets. In this study we consider the case when the TG employs a shoot-look-shoot (SLS) tactic. The SLS tactic requires shooting at the target first, then looking to see if it was killed, and shooting again if necessary to achieve the kill. SLS firing policy has an implicit cost consideration. We only re-fire, if we have not already shot down the threatening ASM. Thus, we do not consume valuable SAM rounds, if it is not necessary.
